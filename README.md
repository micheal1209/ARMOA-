PI3K/AKT Pathway Research with RAG Model
Overview
This project explores the PI3K/AKT pathway using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The system identifies essential genes, such as PIK3CA, AKT1, PTEN, and therapeutic targets, while also analyzing the downstream effects of AKT1 activation. It also includes insights on drugs targeting the pathway, such as Everolimus, Metformin, and Alpelisib. The model helps to bridge the gap between domain expertise and multi-omics data analysis, contributing to cancer research and therapeutic development.

Features
Query system for the PI3K/AKT pathway
Identification of key genes and therapeutic drugs
Exploration of pathway's role in metabolic disorders and cancer
Support for clinical trial data and hypothesis generation
